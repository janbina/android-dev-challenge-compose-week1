# Oh My Goat

![Workflow result](https://github.com/janbina/android-dev-challenge-compose-week1/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
Oh My Goat lists goat pets available for adoption.
You can browse a list of all goats with their names and pictures,
you can see a detail of each goat and you can like your favorite goats!


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I wrote this app for Android Dev Challenge to get my hands on Jetpack Compose.
The most interesting part is the ease of photo loading, using the awesome
[https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist](Accompanist) library.
